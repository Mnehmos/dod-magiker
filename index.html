            <h2>What Is Död Magiker?</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Död Magiker is a tabletop role-playing game about magical rebellion in a world controlled by institutional power. You are a Practitioner—someone who has discovered the truth that reality is malleable, and you're ready to fight back against "the Man."</p>
                
                <p>In this world, magic users have been systematically oppressed by governments, corporations, and academia working together to maintain control over reality itself. The old gods are dead, killed by jealous mortals who now rule through lies and artificial limitations.</p>

                <p><strong>But you know better.</strong> You understand that the Crown of Reality belongs to those bold enough to claim it. Through your mastery of the Arts—Alchemy, Chora, Chronos, Pneuma, Pyr, and Vita—you can reshape the world as it should be.</p>

                    <strong>Warning:</strong> Player characters cannot be allied in any way, shape, or form with the Man or any of their puppets. This is the one rule that cannot be changed.

                <p>Död Magiker uses a simple d20 system with six attributes and six magical Arts. Magic is dangerous, unpredictable, and incredibly powerful—exactly as it should be.</p>
